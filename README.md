# Blazor WebAssembly with Google Login and Individual User Accounts

This project showcases how to implement external identity provider OAuth authentication and integrate it with application-specific individual user accounts in a Blazor WebAssembly application. The project is designed to serve as a practical reference, a starting point and a playground for developers looking to implement authentication to their client-side apps. The solution presented here frees you from managing the sensitive information, like users passwords, in your systems but still maintaining application-specific user accounts on your server, so that users can customize their own experience in your app.

### Developing locally

In order to develop locally and integrate with Google's authentication, you'll need to create your Credentials in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)'s APIs & Services. [See here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred)

Be sure to specify the Blazor WebAssembly app's authentication callback URI in the ```Authorized Redirect URIs``` section:
> https://localhost:5001/google-login-callback 

Then put the ```clientId``` and ```clientSecret``` you get from Google into the user secrets inside the ```BlazorOAuth.API ``` project.

>"Authentication:GoogleOptions:ClientId": "client-id-here"

>"Authentication:GoogleOptions:ClientSecret": "client-secret-here"

**Note:** Included in the project is a powershell script ```Init.ps1``` that will setup a local Docker container SQL Server database for you, all ready to go (you need to have Docker desktop installed).  

Then start both ```BlazorOAuth.API``` and ```BlazorOAuth.Client ``` projects in their respective folders. The API will run EF Core migrations against the local database at startup.
> dotnet run

### Architectural overview

-   **Frontend Authentication**: The Blazor WebAssembly frontend application initiates the authentication process by taking the user to Googleâ€™s authentication page. After the user authenticates with Google, Google returns an authorization code to the frontend application.
-   **Backend Token Exchange**: The frontend then sends this authorization code to the backend API. The backend exchanges the code with Google to retrieve an access token, which includes user information and a unique Google ID which we will use as the unique identifier to be associated with your user account.
-   **User Management**: The backend stores your unique Google ID in the application database and associates it with the user account created during the first sign-in. At the end of successful sign-in, the backend generates a JWT access token (and a refresh token) and returns them to the frontend. The access token is used for communication between the ```BlazorOAuth.Client ``` and ```BlazorOAuth.API``` to ensure that only authorized requests can access protected endpoints. **Note:** We do not store the Google access token, we only need to identify the user in order to create our own JWT.
